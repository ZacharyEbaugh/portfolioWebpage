### Homepage:
The homepage acts as a simple introduction, a title, name, and some buttons for important information.  The top bar will be consistent for the entire webpage except for sidebar.
### Sidebar:
The sidebar is a way to skip around the webpage, there won't be separate loading pages instead it will utilize a snap scroll.
### Projects:
This is the most animated section of the website.  Pictures showcase the applications being presented with direct links to their repositories as well as demoes if available.
### Contact:
This is the bottom of the webpage and allows for direct communication between anyone visiting my page and myself.
## Languages and Implementation:
### HTML5:
Basic HTML was used to create elements for the webpage.  In terms of functionality there was nothing fancy, however new tools I learned about were the use of new tabs for opening links/pdf's from buttons, and the a snap/sticky scroll however this concept was dropped.
### CSS3:

### JavaScript:
