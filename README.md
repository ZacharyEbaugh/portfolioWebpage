### Homepage:
The homepage acts as a simple introduction, a title, name, and some buttons for important information.  The top bar will be consistent for the entire webpage except for sidebar.
### Sidebar:
The sidebar is a way to skip around the webpage, there won't be separate loading pages instead it will utilize a snap scroll.
